# CI: Continuous Integration
Like all open source projects, continuous integration of contributions to the OpenHW Group core-v-verif project is central to what we do.  CI is supported by a unique [work-flow](https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-docs/blob/master/verif/Common/OpenHWGroup_WorkFlow.pdf) specifically developed for this project.

## Simulation Verification
The OpenHW Group continuous integration flow for simulation verification is managed by [Metrics CI toolset](https://www.metrics.ca/).  The configuration file for this is [metrics.json](https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-verif/.metrics.json), which is maintained in this repository.

## Formal Verification
Under development.
