# core-v-verif
Functional verification project for the CORE-V family of RISC-V cores.

## Getting Started
First, have a look at the [OpenHW Group's website](https://www.openhwgroup.org) to learn a bit more about who we are and what we are doing.

The documentation for the various CORE-V cores is located in the [OpenHW Group's CORE-V documentation repo](https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-docs).

If you want to run something, go to cv32/tests/core and look at the README and Makefile.
