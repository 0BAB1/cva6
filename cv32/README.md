# CV32: Verification Environment for the CV32 CORE-V processor core.

## Directories:
- env:   the UVM environment class and its associated infrastrucutre.  Currently empty.
- tb:    the Testbench module that instanitates the core.  Eventually, this will also provide the virtual interfaces to the ENV.  Currently, this is a clone of the RI5CY core testbench.
- tests: this is where all the testcases are.   Go there and read the README!
