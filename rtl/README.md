# RTL: this is it - the CORE-V design files!!!

Currently, the contents of this directory are cloned from the [PULP Platform RI5CY project](https://github.com/pulp-platform/riscv).  Eventually it will be replaced by the RTL from the OpenHW Group CV32 project.  A topic under discussion is whether or not to access the RTL sources via a git module or not.   If you have an opinion, please email mike@openhwgroup.org or message @mikeopenhwgroup on MatterMost.
