# Testbench

The test-bench should evolve according to the following steps:
1.  Basic Usage: Behavioral memories and boot-code. With the option of a EOC flag.
2.  Constrained Random Testing: By co-simulating on a golden model (e.g.: Spike ISA simulator) and comparing signatures. Tests generated by the torture test framework.
3.  System Integration: Complete system integration.
