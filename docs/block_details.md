# Block Details

The processor has 5-stages:

## Next PC Generation (PC Gen)

PC gen is responsible for generating the next program counter. All program counters are logical addressed. If the logical to physical mapping changes a fence instruction should flush the pipeline, caches (?) and TLB.
This stage contains speculation on the next branch target as well as the information if the branch target is taken or not. In addition, it provides ports to the branch history table (BHT) and branch target buffer (BTB).

<!-- If the ID stage decodes a jump and link instruction it sets PC+4 in the RAS. If it the decode stage decodes a return instruction the decode stage kills the program counter in the IF stage and the return address stack is popped accordingly.
 -->
If the branch target buffer decodes a certain PC as a jump the BHT decides if the branch is taken or not.
Because of the various state-full memory structures this stage is split into two pipeline stages. It also provides a handshaking signal to the decode stage to stall the pipeline if this should be necessary (back-pressure).

The next PC can originate from the following sources:

1.  Exception (including interrupts): This also means to figure out to which exception handler the delegate registers are pointing to. If an exception is taken, disable interrupts.
2.  Debug
3.  Request from execute stage (jump, branch) which was not detected as one by the BHT.
4.  Predicted PC (BHT and BTB)
5.  Environment Call (`ecall) instruction. Read the CSRs to figure out where to jump.
6.  Miss-predict: This triggers a pipeline flush and the PC Gen stage starts fetching from there.

### ITLB

## Instruction Fetch (IF)

In the IF stage we already know the physical PC. The request of the instruction is on its way to the instruction memory. We know the result of the BHT and can set the next PC accordingly. At the end of this stage the instruction PC is passed on to the ID stage. Retrieved instructions are stored in an instruction queue.
It is possible that a TLB or cache miss occurred. If this is the case the IF stage signals that it is not ready. The pipeline in the direction of the ID stage will empty itself.

### BTB

### BHT

### Instruction Queue

The instruction queue is part of the IF stage. Its purpose is to decouple the instruction fetch unit as much as possible from the rest of the pipeline.

## Instruction Decode (ID)

The ID stage contains the instruction decode logic (including the planned compressed decoder) as well as the register files (CSR, floating point and regular register file). The decoded instruction is committed to the scoreboard. The scoreboard decides which instruction it can issues next to the execute stage.

### Compressed Decoder
The compressed decoders purpose is to expand a compressed instruction (16 bit) to its 32 bit equivalent.

## Writeback Stage (WB)

The writeback stage is the single commit point in the whole architecture. Everything prior to this stage was just computed in a temporary fashion. This is also the only point where an exception can occur.

### CSR Register File

The CSR register file contains all registers which are not directly related to arithmetic instructions. It contains the following registers supervisor registers:
