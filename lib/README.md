# LIB: Library of reusable verification components

This will eventually be where all the VCs for th CORE-V verification environments are keep.  Examples
include the Google Random Instruction Stream Generator, UVM Agents for various physical interfaces,
memory models, virtual peripherals, etc.

There is a great debate between mike@openhwgroup.org and aimeepsutton@metrics.ca about where the
riscv-gnu-toolchain should go here.  If you have an opinion, send a comment/question to both of us.

Currently, just a placeholder.
